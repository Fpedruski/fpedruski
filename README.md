ðŸ’» I'm a Front-End Developer from Brazil.

ðŸŽ“ At the moment studying to complete my degree in Computer Science.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as freelancer and I'm very hyped to restart my programming life.

ðŸ“– I'm currently learning Javascript, Tailwind, React and UX/UI Design, besides expanding my knowledge on Git/Github.

ðŸ“š I'm also planning to study P5, Processing and Drawing.

:earth: I have experience in Graphic Design, Marketing and a lot of travel.

ðŸ’¬ In addition to web development, science and technology, I like to talk about arts and culture, especially music, movies, painting, travel and books.

ðŸŽ‰ My hobbies are listening to music, playing instruments (guitar, acoustic guitar,piano), watching some series and movies, exercising, searching for recipes, reading and taking care of plants.
